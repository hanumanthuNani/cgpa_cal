CGPA Calculator Project
Overview: The CGPA Calculator is a user-friendly web application designed to help students calculate their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on their course grades across multiple semesters. This tool allows users to input course details, including the number of courses, credits, and grades, and it provides an instant calculation of the CGPA along with feedback based on performance.

Real-Time CGPA Calculation: After entering course details, users can calculate their CGPA without needing to submit the entire form. The result is displayed instantly for each semester.
Interactive Feedback: Based on the calculated CGPA, the application provides animated feedback messages (with emojis) to motivate users, indicating whether their performance is "Great," "Good," "Nice, need to grow," or "Need to study, bro."
User-Friendly Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface is responsive and visually appealing, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
Quick Links: Includes buttons for "Buy Me a Coffee" and a GitHub link, encouraging community support and collaboration.
